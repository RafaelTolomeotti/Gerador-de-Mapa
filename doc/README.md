# Procedural Generation of Open Tibia maps

This contribution describes the in-depth design of OTMapGen: a tool for the procedural generation of Open Tibia maps. This README documents part of the development process.

Hope you enjoy the read,

Forby

## Introduction
Mapping is a term that describes level editing for the previously popular isometric MMORPG Tibia (http://www.tibia.com). Open Tibia is an open-source project that emulates an official Tibia server. Developers can design a server with custom areas, monsters, quests, and other types of game content.

In Tibia, the world is built from 32x32 pixel sprites. Historically, areas used to be designed by hand, with each tile of the tile set deliberately placed. In recent years, tools (e.g. Remere's Map Editor) introduced automatic features: e.g. tile brushing and automated bordering between adjacent tiles.

World maps are saved in the OTBM format. To create world maps we must begin with an application that can read & write from and to this binary file format. 

## Chapter 1: working with the OTBM file format
### 1.1 OTBM2JSON
OTBM2JSON is a NodeJS library written to parse the OTBM files to an intermediary JSON structure. This structure can be programatically modified and written back to the OTBM format. For a detailed implementation please refer to the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Inconcessus/OTBM2JSON](https://github.com/Inconcessus/OTBM2JSON). Below is a description of the OTBM format and its implemetation in the OTBM2JSON library.

### 1.2 OTBM Format Description
The Open Tibia Binary Mapping (OTBM) format is the prevalent format for creating, sharing, and using world maps. Following is a comprehensive description of the binary format. Please note that the byte order of this format is little endian with the least significant byte first. Each file is initialized by four magic bytes:

    0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
    0x4D 0x42 0x54 0x4F (OTBM in ASCII)

Following the file identifier is an nodal tree structure. Each node may have a type, required & optional properties, and multiple children. A new node is initialized by the magic byte `0xFE` and terminated by `0xFF`. Characters followed by `0xFD` are escaped and interpreted as literal.

When a new node is initialized before the current node is terminated, it becomes a child of its parent node. The first byte after the initialization byte determines the type of the node:

    0x00 OTBM_MAP_HEADER
    0x02 OTBM_MAP_DATA
    0x04 OTBM_TILE_AREA
    0x05 OTBM_TILE
    0x06 OTBM_ITEM
    0x0C OTBM_TOWNS
    0x0D OTBM_TOWN
    0x0E OTBM_HOUSETILE
    0x0F OTBM_WAYPOINTS
    0x10 OTBM_WAYPOINT
    
#### OTBM Nodes
##### `0x00` OTBM_MAP_HEADER
The map header contains map metadata that describes the version, height, and width. Given is an example value and the number of bytes for each field.

    0xFE 0x00
    0x02 0x00 0x00 0x00 VERSION (4 bytes) = 2
    0x00 0x08 MAP WIDTH (2 bytes) = 2048
    0x00 0x08 MAP HEIGHT (2 bytes) = 2048
    0x03 0x00 0x00 0x00 ITEM MAJOR VERSION (4 bytes) = 3
    0x39 0x00 0x00 0x00 ITEM MINOR VERSION (4 bytes) = 57
    ...
    0xFD
 
##### `0x02` OTBM_MAP_HEADER
This node type has no required attributes but only additional properties. See the header on additional properties for more information.

    0xFE 0x02
    ... additional properties
    ... children
    0xFD
    
##### `0x04` OTBM_TILE_AREA
The OTBM tile area is a parent node for tiles within its area. The size of this area is always 256x256. By using a parent-child structure the format saves space because each child tile only requires a single byte for both its coordinates in relative tile area coordinates. The tile area itself has its position defined in global coordinates and uses two bytes per coordinate. Level height in the OTBM format is limited to a single byte.

    0xFE 0x04
    0x00 0x00 X-COORDINATE (2 bytes) = 0
    0x00 0x00 Y-COORDINATE (2 bytes) = 0
    0x07 Z-COORDINATE (1 byte) = 7
    ... children
    0xFD

##### `0x05` OTBM_TILE
OTBM tiles define singular squares on the map.The tile position is given in relative coordinates to its parent tile area node. Besides the position the tile may have more properties until the node is terminated.

    0xFE 0x05
    0x00 X-COORDINATE (1 bytes) = 0
    0x00 Y-COORDINATE (1 bytes) = 0
    ... additional properties
    ... children
    0xFD

##### `0x06` OTBM_ITEM
Items are always inherently children of tiles and have a single required entity. There may be multiple additional properties that need to be read.

    0xFE 0x06
    0x64 0x00 ITEM-IDENTIFIER (2 bytes) = 100
    ... additional properties
    ... children
    0xFD

##### `0x0C` OTBM_TOWNS
Parent node for `OTBM_TOWN`.

    0xFE 0x0C
    ... children
    0xFD

##### `0x0D` OTBM_TOWN

    0xFE 0x0D
    0x01 0x00 TOWN-IDENTIFIER (2 bytes) = 1
    0x02 0x00 LENGTH (2 bytes) = 2
    0x72 0x73 STRING (2 bytes ASCII) = "HI"
    0x01 0x00 X-COORDINATE (1 byte) = 1
    0x02 0x00 Y-COORDINATE (1 byte) = 2
    0x03 Z-COORDINATE (1 byte) = 3
    0xFD

##### `0x0E` OTBM_HOUSETILE 
Node that has information on a tile that belongs to a house. This is different from an ordinary tile.

    0xFE 0x0E
    0x01 0x00 X-COORDINATE (1 byte) = 1
    0x02 0x00 Y-COORDINATE (1 byte) = 2
    0x03 0x00 0x00 0x00 HOUSE-IDENTIFIER (4 bytes) = 3
    ... additional properties
    ... children
    0xFD

##### `0x0F` OTBM_WAYPOINTS
Parent node for `OTBM_WAYPOINT`.

    0xFE 0x0F
    ... children
    0xFD

##### `0x10` OTBM_WAYPOINT
Information on an OTBM waypoint

    0xFE 0x10
    0x02 0x00 LENGTH (2 bytes) = 2
    0x72 0x73 STRING (2 bytes ASCII) = "HI"
    0x01 0x00 X-COORDINATE (1 byte) = 1
    0x02 0x00 Y-COORDINATE (1 byte) = 2
    0x03 Z-COORDINATE (1 byte) = 3
    0xFD

    0x01
    0x02 0x00 LENGTH (2 bytes) = 2
    0x72 0x73 STRING (2 bytes ASCII) = "HI"
	
##### `0x02` OTBM_ATTR_EXT_FILE

The following byte is the identifier of a house door in a particular town.

    0x0E
    0x02 (1 byte) = 2

##### `0x0F ` OTBM_ATTR_COUNT
The following byte is the count of an item limited to 255.

    0x0F
    0x08 (1 byte) = 8

##### `0x16 ` OTBM_ATTR_RUNE_CHARGES 
The following byte are the charges of a rune limited to 65535.

    0x16
    0x08 0x00 (2 bytes) = 8

### 1.3 Implementation - OTBM2JSON
With the binary format specification available, reading and writing the OTBM files is quite trivial. We can write simple recursive functions for the reading (`function readNode`) and the writing (`function writeNode`) of the nodes. For detailed information please refer to source code at the repository linked at the top of this chapter. In addition, we need to implement all data structures described above that are triggered on their respective magic initialization bytes. The last step is to remove & add the escape character for escaped literals.

## Chapter 2: Generating realistic terrain using noise functions
Noise functions (e.g. perlin, simplex) provide a way for generating realistic looking terrain. The transformation is a function of relative (x, y) coordinates and returns an elevation.
 
### 2.1 Noise frequency stacking
Noise is generated at a chosen frequency `f`. For a single low frequency (N = 1) we end up with varying degrees of noise-generated elevation. Choosing a single low frequency generates aritificial looking terrain. By stacking increasingly higher frequencies at different weights we end up with more realistic looking terrain.

### 2.2 Elevation function
The function that transforms (x, y) coordinates to elevation is fundamentally based on random noise. However, for each value, we  apply another transformation that manipulates the terrain in a controlled manner. This can mean lowering elevation systematically with distance from the center: to create an island.

The elevation function `function zNoiseFunction` in this repository is complex and the sensitivity of parameters is fairly unpredicatable. 

### 2.3 Mapping elevation to tiles
The simple approach of mapping everything below a certain value to water, then grass, then mountain is chosen. We round the elevation to the nearest integer between 0 and 7 to get the z-coordinate of the tile.

### 2.4 Bordering
Bordering uses a simple algorithm that checks the neighbours for each tile to see what borders need to be applied. This process is similar for grass, water, and mountains. Trees and shrubs are added through a parallel noise map where a high noise represents an area with many trees.

### 2.5 Creating the OTBM
When all tiles and items have been generated, we write the information to a JSON structure that can be used by the OTBM2JSON library. In the end, we write the data to an OTBM file that can be loaded by other tools.

More information to be added eventually 🐢.
